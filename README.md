A recipe for a delicious beefy snack.

Ingredients
----------

- 1 pound 70%+ Lean Ground Beef
- 1 package French and Onion Soup mix
- 1 Diced Onion
- 2 Minced Garlic Cloves
- 3 Slices of Bread cubed and left out Over Night
- 2 Eggs
- 1/2 pound Bacon Strips
- 1 container Sour Cream

Tools
----------
- 1 baking pan
- 2 Disposable Aluminum Cupcake Tin
- Tongs
- Big Old Knife


Process
----------
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2. Using the knife, cut small holes in the bottom of the cup cake tin. This will allow grease and all the bad stuff leak out the bottom of the tin.
3. Open the package of bacon and layer the bacon across the cup cake tin. Make sure to fill in the bottom of the cupcake tin. The bacon will be used as a container to hold the ground beef.
4. Put the cupcake tins on the cookie sheet and throw the bacon in the oven for 15 minutes.  This should crisp up the bacon.
5. Pull the bacon out and set aside for a bit.
6. Brown the Onion and Garlic in a pan with a little bit of oil and salt.  Take the Onion/Garlic combo off the heat and let it cool down.
7. Throw the Ground Beef, French and Onion Soup mix, Browned Onion/Garlic, Bread and Eggs in a big bowl.  Mix together until uniform consistency.
8. Create 12 uniform meatballs and insert into the cupcake tin.
9. Tent the cupcake tin with aluminum foil and throw it in the oven.
10. Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.
11. Uncover and bake for another 15 minutes or until center of Beef Cake is 165 degrees.
